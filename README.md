You have been provided data in JSON format in a file called "housing_data.json"
●	You have to build a REST API that will take the json data as input and store in mysql database
●	Write an API that will give following output when called
○	Average sale price of the house overall
○	Average sale price of the house per location
○	Max sale price
○	Min sale price
●	All the above output has to be generated using SQL Queries vs calculations in java code
Note:
●	Bonus points for handling error cases in the rest APIs
●	Bonus points for good json format based response and using right HTTP response codes
